Local Dish Corner
This is a web app that brings together vendors and buyers on the same platform.

Problem Statement: 
The lack of visibility and accessibility of local culinary offerings within the community. Despite the rich diversity and uniqueness of local cuisines, many residents and visitors are unaware of the delicious options available nearby. This lack of awareness leads to the underutilization of local eateries, missed opportunities for businesses to thrive, and a diminished sense of community pride. Additionally, traditional marketing channels may not effectively reach potential customers, further exacerbating the issue.

To create a platform that showcases local restaurants, food vendors, and culinary experiences, making it easier for people to discover, support, and enjoy the vibrant food culture of their community.
