Local Dish Corner

This is a webapp that brings together vendors and buyers on the same platform. It serves as a marketplace that allows users to find what they are looking for; vendors, to sell their local cuisines and customers to find vendors near them that provide authentic meals.

Problem Statement: 

The lack of visibility and accessibility of local culinary offerings within the community. Despite the rich diversity and uniqueness of local cuisines, many residents and visitors are unaware of the delicious options available nearby. This lack of awareness leads to the underutilization of local eateries, missed opportunities for businesses to thrive, and a diminished sense of community pride. Additionally, traditional marketing channels may not effectively reach potential customers, further exacerbating the issue.

Problem Solution: 
To create a platform that showcases local restaurants, food vendors, and culinary experiences, making it easier for people to discover, support, and enjoy the vibrant food culture of their community.

Product Features:
User authentication:
- Allow users to register, log in, and securely authenticate their identity.
- We used bcrypt for password hashing.
Search and discovery:
- Search bar with powerful search options
Restaurant profiles:
- Detailed information on each restaurant's profiles
Admin dashboard
- A dashboard for all vendors to track their sales

Technologies Used
- Frontend: Html, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript (React)
    I use Vite as my build tool. 
- Backend: Express, Node.js
- Database: MongoDB
- Authentication: bcrypt for password hashing.

Frontend
We used React library to optimize on usability of the components. 
We used Bootstrap for their encapsulated components to create easy and visually appealing webapp. 


Backend
We leverage Node.js and Express.js to build a robust backend infrastructure. Our database management system of choice is MongoDB, and we employ Mongoose for optimized modeling.

Technologies Used
- Node.js: A powerful JavaScript runtime environment that allows us to execute server-side code.
- Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- MongoDB: A leading NoSQL database program, known for its flexibility, scalability, and performance.
- Mongoose: An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment. It provides a straightforward schema-based solution to model application data.

Security Measures
- bcrypt: We utilize bcrypt for password hashing, ensuring secure storage of sensitive user credentials. By employing bcrypt, we mitigate the risk of password-related vulnerabilities such as brute-force attacks and rainbow table attacks.

Project Structure
- Our backend follows a structured architecture, with separate modules for different functionalities:

Methodologies:

Next Iteration and Future Plans While I'm proud of the progress I've made with the Time Tracker Application, I envision several improvements and additional features for future iterations, including:

Advanced Reporting: Enhancing the reporting capabilities by providing detailed insights and analytics on time usage, productivity trends, and task categorization.

Mobile App: Developing a mobile application version of the Time Tracker to ensure accessibility and convenience for users who prefer tracking their time on their smartphones or tablets.

Collaboration and Team Features: Introducing collaboration features to facilitate teamwork, such as shared projects, team calendars, and collaborative task management.



To get started:
1. Make sure you have Node in your system.
2. clone the repository.
3. install all the dependencies 
    use: npm install
4. Start the server
    npm run dev
5. open your browser, and your project will be on 
    http://localhost:5173/
    http://localhost:5001/





Frontend Design: Creating a user-friendly and visually appealing frontend interface using modern web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with frameworks like React or Vue.js, posed challenges in terms of UI/UX design, responsiveness, and smooth interaction with the backend API.


Deployment and Scalability: Setting up the deployment environment, configuring servers, and ensuring the application's scalability and performance were essential aspects to consider for a production-ready application.

Struggles and Lessons Learned During the development process, I faced various challenges and roadblocks that tested my problem-solving skills and forced me to dive deeper into specific technologies and concepts. Some of the struggles I encountered include:

Database Design: Designing an optimal database schema and handling data relationships efficiently proved to be more complex than initially anticipated. I had to revise and refine the data models to ensure data integrity and performance.

User Experience: Designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface required continuous iteration and soliciting feedback from potential users. Balancing simplicity with powerful features was a constant challenge, and I had to prioritize essential functionalities to avoid overwhelming the users.

Authentication Security: Implementing secure authentication and authorization was crucial to protect user data. I encountered challenges in handling password encryption, token-based authentication, and preventing common security vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) or cross-site request forgery (CSRF). Rigorous testing and adopting best practices helped address these concerns.
